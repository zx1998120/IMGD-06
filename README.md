# IMGD-06

The variation I added fpr this project is aging. In this version, each live cell has an age that increases each generation. If its age reaches a set maximum (we say 10 here), the cell dies even if it would normally survive. In addition, the fill color of a live cell changes (from green to red) as it ages.
